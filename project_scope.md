   - Flags risky/inappropriate AI applications

3. WHAT does it NOT do?
   - Does NOT give theological/doctrinal advice
   - Does NOT replace pastoral judgment
   - Does NOT access private church data

4. WHAT are the governance features?
   - Source citations (every answer traceable)

   - A pastor asks "Should AI handle counseling?" → Gets clear "NO" with reasons
   - Every answer has: source, date, and "consult a pastor" disclaimer
